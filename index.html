          Hi, I'm May! I'm a Sophomore studying Computer Science at UW. In an attempt
          to discover my interests and career path, I'm exploring many opportunities at UW by
          taking a variety of classes. I particularly enjoy CSE 154, a web programming course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from academics, I'm currently involved in many Registered Student Organizations
          (RSOs), including SEED, Dawg Daze, and Acts 2 Fellowship (A2F). I'm also very excited to
          join the 2020-21 Resident Adviser (RA) team!
        </p>
